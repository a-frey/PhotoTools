# PhotoTools

## Why
We own 4 different devices for taking photos. Each of these devices use different pattern for saving the files. In addition there are pictures from WhatsApp, Threema, etc. It is hard to order the pictures in chronological order.

## What
Implement a small desktop client, to rename the images according to the schema "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss(_000x).png". Why desktop for windows? Because I wanted to try out WPF.

## How
- C#
- WPF
